        <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>An appreciation of the most common programm in the world</h2>
        <br>
        <p>No one particularly liked doing "Hello World" programs, and
            everyone has skipped over them, sooner or later. Why should
            someone go through a guided example of a useless program?
            Itnis a fair question, but it is a question that misses the point.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>It is not about making something useful, it is about showing
            you the basic template of the language or framework you are using.
            It is like the training level og a video game. You are press
            <code>A</code> to jump, here is a save point, there is something
            that will get you into trouble. Maybe you are so experienced with
            these types of games that you can skip the training levels and get right
            into it and work it out. To be fair, this works for most video games,
            except, most video games have at most 10 distinct actions you can
            take. Jump, walk, run, shoot, interact... in programming, you have
            a seemingly ifinite number of actions available to you. So, do
            yourself a favor and take the time to get familiar with the basics.
